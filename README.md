SciGalactica, a fine tuned Llama-2 model using Nougat for Dataset compilation

# SciGalactica

SciGalactica is a cutting-edge project combining Nougat's data processing capabilities with the advanced language modeling of Llama-2, inspired by the Galactica model, to create a specialized AI tool for scientific data synthesis and analysis.

## About the Project

SciGalactica aims to harness the exponential growth of scientific data, transforming it into structured, actionable knowledge. It stands at the intersection of advanced OCR technology and sophisticated language processing.

### Key Components

- **Nougat**: Central to our data preparation, Nougat employs state-of-the-art OCR techniques to convert scientific documents from various formats into structured, machine-readable data. This is crucial for accurately capturing complex scientific information, including mathematical equations and scientific notations.

- **Llama-2**: At the heart of SciGalactica, Llama-2 is fine-tuned to perform high-level reasoning and synthesis across scientific disciplines. Its large-scale language model, with up to 70 billion parameters, is adept at understanding context, generating insights, and providing coherent answers to complex scientific queries.

- **Galactica Inspiration**: Galactica's prowess in handling vast scientific knowledge guides our approach. We aim to replicate its success in combining and reasoning about diverse scientific data. This model's ability to outperform existing models in tasks like LaTeX equations and scientific reasoning sets a benchmark for SciGalactica.

## Goal

Our goal is to make scientific discovery more intuitive and accessible. By processing massive amounts of data and presenting it in an understandable format, SciGalactica seeks to accelerate research and foster innovative breakthroughs in various scientific fields.
